            <p> You would be hard pressed to find a way to open your own business with
                the really low entry threshold that comes with a custom t-shirt brand.
                Finding an audience that is interested in purchasing t-shirts isn’t the
                hard part. It’s finding the right audience for your design ideas!</p>

            <h1>Mug Design</h1>
           
            <p> Coffee mugs with catchy messages, sweet sayings, or unique artwork have held
                a place in people’s hearts for years. Treasured as gifts and for holding your
                favourite morning beverage, coffee mugs are a staple in today’s kitchens,
                offices, and boardrooms. <br> <br>

                And, believe it or not, mugs go back thousands of years, although what we
                think of as the “traditional” coffee mug was designed as recently as 1945.</p>

        <p> No matter what industry you operate in or what products you’re selling, 
            a high-quality brochure or catalogue can be one of the most effective
            marketing tools for your business – one that sets you apart from competitors.
            This is a chance to showcase your products in a format that speaks to your quality,
            craftsmanship and will appeal to your customer’s aesthetics.</p>

        <h1>Magazine Design</h1>

        <p> Local magazines are highly valued and respected
            publications that build a sense of community
            among local consumers. In fact, many people turn
            to local publications as a source of advice,
            information, entertainment, knowledge, and more. <br> <br>
     
            Advertisers can greatly benefit from this credibility,
            when their ads are viewed not as ads but as
            recommendations from a trusted source.</p>

        <h1>Calander Design</h1>

        <p>Calendars are a cost effective way to market your company.
            They are purchased yearly by the majority of people and used as
            a way to keep track of important dates and appointments at a glance.
            Despite the growing popularity of the internet and accessing things online,
            it’s still convenient to have a print calendar on the wall in a kitchen,
            bedroom or home office to add a bit of decoration and organisational function to a room.</p>

        <p>Posters are a great way to convey your message.
            It is the visual appeal of this promotional tool,
            which contributes to its success. No wonder, posters
            have always been in vogue, as far as

        <p>Did you know that over 90% of the information we process is visual?
           That’s why infographic design is a very popular and extremely effective
           way to communicate with your target audiences, regardless of sector you operate in. <br> <br>
           As marketing tools, website content or an educational resource, infographics are a
           visually appealing way to simplify your message and engage with your audience in ways
           that will trigger exactly the kind of reaction you’re aiming for.</p>

        <h1>Vector Design</h1>

        <p>Vector artwork is art that's made up of vector graphics. These graphics are points,
            lines, curves and shapes that are based on mathematical formulas. When you scale a
            vector image file, it isn't low resolution and there's no loss of quality,
            so it can be sized to however large or small you need it to be. It's an excellent
            tool for putting company logos on business cards, creating poster designs, and
            when photo-shopping in Adobe Photoshop. Any art made with vector illustration
            software like Adobe Illustrator is considered vector art.</p>

            move in an eye-catching way using any number of artistic styles.
            Although they may integrate live action video, they don't require
            any live action recording to convey an idea or story.</p>
