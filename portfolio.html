            <p> You would be hard pressed to find a way to open your own business with <br>
                the really low entry threshold that comes with a custom t-shirt brand. <br>
                Finding an audience that is interested in purchasing t-shirts isn’t the <br>
                hard part. It’s finding the right audience for your design ideas!</p>

            <h1>Mug Design</h1>
           
            <p> Coffee mugs with catchy messages, sweet sayings, or unique artwork have held <br>
                a place in people’s hearts for years. Treasured as gifts and for holding your <br>
                favourite morning beverage, coffee mugs are a staple in today’s kitchens, <br>
                offices, and boardrooms. <br> <br>

                And, believe it or not, mugs go back thousands of years, although what we <br>
                think of as the “traditional” coffee mug was designed as recently as 1945.</p>

        <h1>Magazine Design</h1>

        <p> Local magazines are highly valued and respected <br>
            publications that build a sense of community <br>
            among local consumers. In fact, many people turn <br>
            to local publications as a source of advice, <br>
            information, entertainment, knowledge, and more. <br> <br>
     
            Advertisers can greatly benefit from this credibility <br>
            when their ads are viewed not as ads but as <br>
            recommendations from a trusted source.</p>

        <p>Calendars are a cost effective way to market your company. <br>
            They are purchased yearly by the majority of people and used as <br>
            a way to keep track of important dates and appointments at a glance. <br>
            Despite the growing popularity of the internet and accessing things online, <br>
            it’s still convenient to have a print calendar on the wall in a kitchen, <br>
            bedroom or home office to add a bit of decoration and organisational function to a room.</p>

            It is the visual appeal of this promotional tool, <br>

        <p>Did you know that over 90% of the information we process is visual? <br>
           That’s why infographic design is a very popular and extremely effective <br>
           way to communicate with your target audiences, regardless of sector you operate in. <br> <br>
           As marketing tools, website content or an educational resource, infographics are a <br>

        <h1>Vector Design</h1>

        <p>Vector artwork is art that's made up of vector graphics. These graphics are points, <br>
            lines, curves and shapes that are based on mathematical formulas. When you scale a <br>
            vector image file, it isn't low resolution and there's no loss of quality, <br>
            so it can be sized to however large or small you need it to be. It's an excellent <br>
            tool for putting company logos on business cards, creating poster designs, and <br>
            when photo-shopping in Adobe Photoshop. Any art made with vector illustration <br>
            software like Adobe Illustrator is considered vector art.</p>

            move in an eye-catching way using any number of artistic styles. <br>
