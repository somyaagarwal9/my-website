            <p> You would be hard pressed to find a way to open your own business with <br>
                the really low entry threshold that comes with a custom t-shirt brand. <br>
                Finding an audience that is interested in purchasing t-shirts isn’t the <br>
                hard part. It’s finding the right audience for your design ideas!</p>

            <p> Coffee mugs with catchy messages, sweet sayings, or unique artwork have held <br>
                a place in people’s hearts for years. Treasured as gifts and for holding your <br>
                favourite morning beverage, coffee mugs are a staple in today’s kitchens, <br>
                offices, and boardrooms. <br> <br>

                And, believe it or not, mugs go back thousands of years, although what we <br>
                think of as the “traditional” coffee mug was designed as recently as 1945.</p>

        <h1>Magazine Design</h1>

        <p> Local magazines are highly valued and respected <br>
            publications that build a sense of community <br>
            among local consumers. In fact, many people turn <br>
            to local publications as a source of advice, <br>
            information, entertainment, knowledge, and more. <br> <br>
     
            Advertisers can greatly benefit from this credibility <br>
            when their ads are viewed not as ads but as <br>
            recommendations from a trusted source.</p>

        <h1>Calander Design</h1>

        <p>Calendars are a cost effective way to market your company. <br>
            They are purchased yearly by the majority of people and used as <br>
            a way to keep track of important dates and appointments at a glance. <br>
            Despite the growing popularity of the internet and accessing things online, <br>
            it’s still convenient to have a print calendar on the wall in a kitchen, <br>
            bedroom or home office to add a bit of decoration and organisational function to a room.</p>
